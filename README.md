# GIS Data Automation Series

This repository showcases my geospatial data automation skills across three specialized workflows using:
- ArcPy (ArcGIS Pro scripting - In progress)
- FME + Python (graphical ETL + scripting - Planned)
- PyQGIS + PostGIS (open-source GIS + spatial DB - Planned)

> Each mini-project highlights a specific automation strategy that reflects my capabilities in:
- Batch processing
- Database integration
- Spatial ETL scripting
- Attribute-level logic automation
