# 🌍 GIS Data Automation Portfolio

Welcome to my **6-day portfolio project**, where I showcase hands-on projects in GIS data automation, spatial ETL, web mapping, cloud deployment, and CI/CD. These projects are tailored to highlight my capabilities for remote sensing, geospatial engineering, and intelligent workflow automation.

## 🧠 Goals
- Build automation workflows for spatial data with real-world, end-to-end demos
- Integrate SQL, Python, and GIS tools with cloud & devops
- Visualize insights through Streamlit and Leafmap
